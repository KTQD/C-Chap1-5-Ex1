## Write a C program that includes two functions:
- `centigradeToFahrenheit`: A function that takes a temperature in Centigrade as input and returns its equivalent in Fahrenheit.
- `printWeatherCondition`: A function that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as input and prints out the corresponding weather condition.
## Implement the main function as follows:
- Initialize a variable temperature with a Centigrade value.
- Calculate the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit using the centigradeToFahrenheit function.
- Print the Centigrade and Fahrenheit temperatures with one decimal place.
Call the printWeatherCondition function with the Fahrenheit temperature to display the weather condition.
## Run and Test
### Input
```
4.2
```
### Output
```
4.2 Centigrade is equivalent to 39.6 Fahrenheit
It's cold
```
